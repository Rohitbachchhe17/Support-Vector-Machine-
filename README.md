# Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. The hyperplane is chosen such that the margin (distance) between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors) from each class is maximized.

# Decision Boundary in SVM:

The decision boundary in SVM is the hyperplane that separates the data points belonging to different classes. For binary classification, the decision boundary is the line, plane, or hyperplane that best separates the data points of one class from those of the other class. In multidimensional feature spaces, the decision boundary is a hyperplane.

# Types of SVM:

- Linear SVM: Uses a linear hyperplane to separate the classes.
- Non-linear SVM: Uses a non-linear kernel function (such as polynomial, Gaussian radial basis function) to map the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear hyperplane can separate the classes.

# Advantages of SVM:

- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- Memory efficient as it uses only a subset of training points (support vectors) to define the decision boundary.
- Versatile as it supports different kernel functions for handling non-linear data.
- Robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

# Disadvantages of SVM:

- Computationally intensive, especially for large datasets.
- Can be sensitive to the choice of kernel parameters.
- Not suitable for multi-class classification without additional strategies (e.g., one-vs-one or one-vs-all).

# Applications of SVM:

- Text categorization and sentiment analysis.
- Image classification and recognition.
- Handwriting recognition.
- Bioinformatics (e.g., protein classification).
- Financial forecasting.
- Medical diagnosis (e.g., cancer classification).
- Intrusion detection in cybersecurity.
